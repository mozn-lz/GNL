Within the text of most pages, there are usually a large number of hypertext links to other pages within the wiki. Wikis can provide one or more ways to categorize or tag pages to support the maintenance of such index pages. Some wikis, including the original, have a backlink feature, which displays all pages that link to a given page. It is also typically possible in a wiki to create links to pages that do not yet exist, as a way to invite others to share what they know about a subject new to the wiki.

Linking and creating pages
Links are created using a specific syntax, the so-called link pattern.
Originally, most wikis[citation needed] used 
CamelCase to name pages and create links. These are produced by 
capitalizing words in a phrase and removing the spaces between them (the word CamelCase is itself an example). While CamelCase makes linking easy, it also leads to links in a form that deviates
from the standard spelling. To link to a page with a single-word title, one must abnormally capitalize one of the letters in the word (e.g. WiKi instead of Wiki). 
CamelCase-based 
wikis 


are 

instantly recognizable because they have many links with names such as TableOfContents and BeginnerQuestions.
It is possible
For example, RichardWagner should be rendered as Richard Wagner, whereas PopularMusic should be rendered as popular music. 
There is no easy way to determine which 
capital letters should remain capitalized. 
As a result, many wikis now have free
linking

using 

brackets, and some disable CamelCase by 

fault.
